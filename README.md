# Introduction
You might think of a Game of Thrones character when you think of the name Tansy, but really it is a beautiful, yet tricky, plant common in Limburg, The Netherlands. It is known for its bright yellow round flower heads which can withstand fierce weather circumstances. That is probably why the plant got its name: Tanacetum Vulgare. 

# Origin 
Tanacetum Vulgare, in English known as Tansy, Garden Tansy, or Golden Buttons, is partially named after the Ancient Greek word for “Immortal” (Tanacetum), as the plant does not easily wither, and the flowers maintain their yellow colour during all of Summer, and even weeks beyond (generally June-September) (GroenRijk, n.d.; Weijkamp, n.d.). Vulgare means “common” in Ancient Greek, as the plant is naturally prevalent (Vreeken's zaden, n.d.). 
Another name for tansy in Ancient Greek was “anthanasia”, which means immortal: “a” meaning “without”, and “thanatos” meaning “death”; without death (Klingaman, 2013). Latin and Greek are both branches of the Indo-European language family, however, are not completely similar. Latin used the word “tanasia” for Tanacetum Vulgare, which can be traced to the English version of “tansy” (Klingaman, 2013).

The Dutch name is Boerenwormkruid (and Frisian: Wormkruud), which translates to “Farmers-worm-herb”, as a toxic substance called thujone in the plant was used to repel round- and tapeworms during the Middle Ages (Rookmaker, 2017). Thujone is an oil which can be harmful to your health, or even lead to one's death, after ingesting a large quantity (Camden-Grey: Essential Oils, n.d.). For parasites, such as worms, it can be lethal. Similar to Dutch, the Germans refer to Tanacetum Vulgare and its worm-repellent quality by calling it: Rainfarn or Wurmkraut (Brumagne, n.d.). The French name is Tanaisie Commune. Tanaisie refers to “Tanacetum”, and Commune refers to “common” (Brumagne, n.d.). 

# Habitat
Tansy can grow multiple years in a row, and is recognisable for the round yellow flowers at the tips of the branches (Brumagne, n.d.). Tansy is a compass plant, meaning the flowers turn to the sun (Athemis.nl, n.d.). The plant flourishes during the months of June until September, or even October (Brumagne, n.d.). This plant is often found next to roads or farmland, and usually is found in groups as Tansy grows pretty aggressively, therefore, can take up space of neighbouring plants. 

# Biodiversity
Tansy can be used to help organisms, though, nearly always while negatively impacting another. The oil in the plant is toxic for most, which causes harm to animals such as insects, worms, but also cattle or pets. Humans use tansy to kill insects hiding in their crops, so their crops can grow healthily. For example, various beetles such as cucumber, potato, and blister beetles stay away from the respective crops, when planted next to tansy (Klingaman, 2013). 
Furthermore, tansy can be used to clean and disinfect bee hives, or assist bees to retrieve into their hive (Vlindertuin de Zindering, n.d.). Some say tansy repels the “wrong” bugs; the ones that eat your crops, while it attracts the “right” bugs, such as ladybugs, and butterflies (Alchemy Works, n.d.). There has not been substantial proof of this. 

# Growing Tansy
Tansy needs a minimum of six hours of sunlight to thrive, therefore, half-shade is a good place to start growing (Klingaman, 2013).  It is adaptable to a wide array of soil types (peat, river and sea clay, sand, dune, and loess), and is quite drought tolerant once established (Klingaman, 2013). Perfect soil types are river dunes, dikes, and verges next to car roads (Flora van Nederland, n.d.; Weijkamp, n.d.). Nitrogen-rich ground compliments the plant’s growth (Flora van Nederland, n.d.). The plant can grow quite aggressively, and take up sunlight from surrounding plants, which is why tansy should border equally vigorous plants, for all of them to stay healthy (Klingaman, 2013). Great plants to grow next to tansy would be crops, such as cabbages, roses, potatoes, raspberries, and grapes, as tansy protects them from insects (Kussler, n.d.). Just before the blooming period of the tansy starts in early summer, it can be helpful to cut the plant down to the ground, thereby forcing growth from the ==rhizomes=={Q184208} (Klingaman, 2013). 
‘Isla Gold’, the gold-leafed tansy, is shorter growing than the species and is the form commonly offered in the nursery trade. 

# History
Tansy has been growing for more than 2000 years, first being recorded in ==Greek botanical writings=={XXXXXX}. It is native over a wide area of Europe, Asia, and North America, and its present range presumably is increased by humans as they travel throughout the continents continuously (Klingaman, 2013). 

Tansy and immortality are connected throughout time. In Greek Mythology the young man Ganymede becomes immortal when the God Zeus takes an interest in him, and grants him an immortality drink made with Tansy. After drinking it, Ganymede becomes immortal, and is abducted to serve the Gods as a cupbearer on Mount Olympus (Wikipedia, 2020). The kidnapper of Ganymede is described as either Zeus, an eagle, or someone else, either way, the kidnapper supposedly was taken away by Ganymede’s beauty (Ray, 2020). Some people say this story reflects a story of ==pederasty=={Q1294184}, which was a common storyline in this Greek period (Archaic, and Classical Greek) (Ray, 2020). Subsequently, this story reflects the connection of Tansy and immortality. 

During the Middle Ages people used Tansy to scare witches and ghosts away. Besides its worm-repellent qualities, it was used to induce miscarriages, as it can cause your uterus to contract when ingested in high doses (Brumagne, n.d.; WebMD, 2019). Additionally, during the century of ==Black Death=={Q42005}, when the plague was overwhelmingly present in the Netherlands, it became known that the disease spread through the air, and had a recognisable bad smell. Therefore, doctors and medicinal practitioners wore beak-shaped masks filled with juniper berries and tansy to filter the air they breathed in (Rookmaker, 2017). This was prior to the now commonly known ==Germ Theory of Disease=={Q1425837}, so this mask was not designed to kill germs, but rather clean the diseased air. It caught the air in the beak of the mask, which held the herbs such as tansy to “clean the air”, before it reached the nose and mouth. Back then, people believed sweet perfumes were able to fumigate plague-stricken areas, and protect whomever wore it (Blakemore, 2020). 

In the 19th century, people of importance were often buried with a crown of tansy on their heads as a symbol of immortality. The flower crown was said to slow down postmortem decay, as worms kept away from the body. Additionally, certain people added tansy to the coffin as well (Athemis.nl, n.d.). 

Due to the plant’s association with immortality, it is likewise associated with death. Therefore, it has become less popular over time (Athemis.nl, n.d.). That can be supported by the fact that nowadays most people in the Netherlands view tansy as a weed (Vlindertuin de Zindering, n.d.). 
Although technically, any plant can subjectively be described as weed in the Netherlands. There are no guidelines for weed identification (Pokon, 2024). Therefore, “weed” does not have an official classification, and any plant could technically be labelled as a weed (Hoogerkamp & Stryckers, 1990). It depends on the person classifying a plant whether or not a plant is considered a weed. 

# Medicinal purpose
Butterfly Garden the Zindering (NL: Vlindertuin de Zindering) claims tansy has some medicinal qualities, such as to prevent or cure ==scabies=={Q167178}, as well as ==arthritis=={Q170990} and a common cold. Putting tansy in your shoes is said to help prevent chronic fever (Vlindertuin de Zindering, n.d.). 

# Nutritional value
Tansy has a strong scent if you break, bruise, or rub the plant’s leaves or flowers. The smell is somewhat bitter, similar to ==camphor=={XXXX} (a cool, spicy, somewhat woody, somewhat earthy smell) (Brumagne, n.d.). The taste can be described as similar to rosemary (Alchemy Works, n.d.). 
Pregnant people are discouraged to consume Tansy, due to the poisonous ingredient thujone, which can increase chances of inducing foetal malformation (Tisserand & Young, 2014).
Unfortunately, there is too little research conducted to confirm an acceptable daily intake (ADI), therefore, you are highly encouraged to contact a health professional such as a doctor or pharmacist to ask what responsible dosages of tansy would mean for you, as it differs for each person (WebMD, 2019). It has been said that ingesting tansy from natural sources, such as leaves of the plant prepared as food, are less likely to have a dangerous high dosage of thujone, compared to unnatural sources of tansy, such as medicine, or oil, as those are far more concentrated (WebMD, 2019). 
Furthermore, alcohol and tansy can interact with each other, thus should never be consumed on the same day. Both alcohol and tansy have a tiring effect, and can be dangerous when taken simultaneously (WebMD, 2019). The leaves and flowers of the plant are edible for humans. If consumed in large quantities, the plant can cause liver damage, therefore, should be considered carefully when consumed (Baroen, n.d.). 
Pets such as dogs, rabbits, horses, and chickens can eat small amounts of tansy each day to prevent parasitic worms contamination. Cats cannot bear the active substances in tansy, therefore, should not be given any amount of tansy ever. Furthermore, small amounts of tansy can be spread over a pet’s sleeping basket to prevent worms from entering (Baroen, n.d.).

The early-spring flowers of tansy have a fresh taste, and can be used in baked goods such as cakes, or pies. Young leaves are suitable for soups or salads, as well as enriching gins or liquors. The beauty lies in the smell of the glass you drink out of. Burn a small amount of tansy and place your glass on top of it, upside down so all smoke is caught in the glass. When you serve the gin in this glass it will remain flavoured from the smoking and have a particular taste of tansy (Brumagne, n.d.). 
In the city of Diest (Belgium) people bake pancakes named Diesterse kruidkoek, which entail Tansy (Brumagne, n.d.).

# Cultural significance
## Religion
Even in religious findings tansy appears. According to the website Alchemy-works.com, a Christian tradition called ==Lent=={Q82866} used to be celebrated with cakes enriched with tansy (exact time period unknown). Together with lovage and yarrow it was made into a cordial (either a syrup or alcoholic drink), which used to be popular in Britain (Alchemy Works, n.d.). 
Tansy was mixed with egg, flour, and milk, baked like a pancake, and eaten during Easter, to warn off worms that might be ingested due to the British fish-based diet of that time (The Wildlife Trusts, n.d.). 
A quote from the ==Quran=={Q428} (Dahr: 5-6) mentions a mixture of Kafoor, which Ali (2014) explains is camphor, and can be found in leaves of tansy, and other plants.

## Art
Tansy is available on ==Etsy=={Q1353939} in the form of a pastel oil painting. Green leaves make green paint, yellow flowers make yellow paint (Athemis.nl, n.d.). For example, paint can be used to dye wool (Alchemy Works, n.d.). 

## Superstition
Tansy is one of the flowers used in herbal wash (NL: kruidenwis). This particular herbal wash consisted of seven to nine herbs that were hung in a central spot in a home, and protected it from lightning strikes, fire, accidents, and fights during the dark months of winter (Rookmaker, 2017). 

## Poetry
Lastly, a few gorgeous poems, mostly about seasons and weather, are showcased down below. 

An English Poem by flowerfairies.com (no date).
Title: The Tansy Fairy (NL: de Boerenwormkruid Fee)

In busy kitchens, in olden days,
Tansy was used in a score of ways;
Chopped and pounded,
when cooks would make
Tansy puddings and tansy cake,
Tansy posset, or tansy tea;
Physic or flavouring tansy’d be.
People who know
Have told me so!

That is my tale of the past; today,
Still I’m here by the King’s Highway,
Where the air from the fields
is fresh and sweet,
With my fine-cut leaves and my flowers neat.
Were ever such button-like flowers seen—
Yellow, for elfin coats of green?
Three in a row—
I stitch them so!

A Dutch Poem by Han Messie, 2010.
Title: Wonderen in dood getij (EN: Wonders in neap tide)

Triest decemberweer;
boerenwormkruid wiegt geurend
als in de zomer.

De vrouw krijgt weeën:
kadetjes kauwen doet haar
plezierig lijden.

Het meer brult, schuimt woest:
zeilen, wimpel en vlag slaan
één trillende maat.

Voor het zwarte raam
staat een elektrische kaars,
gloeit sierlijk schokkend.

In de winterwei
liggen schapen knus bijeen,
herkauwen druipnat.

Twee zwarte schapen
stappen verwoed door struiken,
zijn ruig als bizons.

Koude morgenrijp versterkt
de geur van kerstgebak.

Een kerstboomlamp brandt
verstopt in engelenhaar:
vèr _ verstrooid schijnsel.

In het stille bos
klinkt de verre snelweg zacht
als bomengeruis.

We gaan door het bos,
komen op een oud landgoed:
hier zie je echt woùd.

Another Dutch poem by Roel van Ekeris, 2020.
Title: Akkerleven (EN: farm field life)

Kneutjes kwetteren
Goudgele aren
Akkerbloemen
De sfeer zal je opsparen
 
Zandpad tussen granen
Duizendblad, boerenwormkruid
Paars kleurende distels
In dromenland wanen
 
Zonlicht speelt
Windspel, aren verdeelt
Sporen van een vossengang
Ratelaars en Grote groene sprinkhanen
 
Gedachten terugschroeven
Je laat de dingen gaan
Niets te moeten niets te hoeven
Vrijheidsgevoel komt er spontaan
